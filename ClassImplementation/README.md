A Class structure implementation of the quasi-steady model described in the root of this repository.  In addition to the original functions, a fly-gen system is also implemented and demonstrated using the example files. 

## How to cite

If you use the model then please cite the corresponding paper:

Joshi, R., Schmehl, R., and Kruijff, M.: Power curve modelling and scaling of fixed-wing ground-generation airborne wind energy systems, Wind Energ. Sci., 9, 2195–2215, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-9-2195-2024, 2024.

## Dependencies

The model is built and tested in MATLAB R2021b. Try installing this version if your version of MATLAB does not execute the code successfully.

## Installation and execution

Please Clone or Download the repository to start using the model. Go into the `ClassImplementation` folder, where the main run script can be found.

## Overview of the Repository

The Repository consists following folders:

1. `src`: Contains the source code of the model.
2. `inputFiles`: Contains some pre-defined input files.
3. `outputFiles`: Contains some generated output files using the pre-defined input files.
4. `lib`: Contains external functions required to run the model.
5. ## Pre-defined Example Simulation

Pre-defined input files named `inputFile_example_Class_*.yml` are stored in the folder `inputFiles` and defined for both a fly-gen and pumping cycle fixed-wing (ground-gen) system. These input files simulates a system with rated electrical power of 150 kW for ground-gen and 100 kW for the fly-gen system.

1. Execute `class_run_awePower_*.m` to generate and save model outputs. The outputs will be stored in the folder `outputFiles`. Name of every output file is prefixed with the respective input file name.
2. Run `simulationQSM.plot_all_results();` to visualize relevant outputs.

## To Run with User-defined Inputs

1. A data structure named 'inputs' needs to be created with all necessary inputs as defined in `inputFile_example_Class_*.yml` from the `inputFiles` folder.
2. Results can be generated by executing the script `class_run_awePower_*.m`. Within the script, ensure to pass as an argument, the name of your newly defined input sheet.
3. Results can be visualized by executing the script `simulationQSM.plot_all_results();`. Within the script, ensure to load your specific input file.

### Generated Output Files

The generated output files have a prefix as the name of the used input file. Following .mat files get stored in the `outputFiles` folder.

1. `optimDetails` has the details regarding the optimization.
2. `outputs` has all the raw outputs.
3. `processedOutputs` has post-processed relevant outputs for better visualization.
